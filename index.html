			<br>
			<p>
			Currently, I work at <a href="https://www.prodigymold.com" target="_blank">Prodigy Mold & Tool, Inc.</a> as an apprentice machinist, specializing in Sinker EDM operation. I have previous experience working at <i>Morning Star Farms LLC</i> raising turkeys and operating machinery from skidloaders to farm tractors.
			</p>

			<p>
			I graduated from <a href="https://www.gshs.sgibson.k12.in.us/en-US" target="_blank">Gibson Southern High School</a> with a Core 40 with Technical Honors. During my final 2 years of high school I also attended, and graduated from, <a href="https://sictc.evscschools.com" target="_blank">Southern Indiana Career & Technical Center</a> where I studied Computer Science.
			</p>

			<p>
			I have interests in computer software and low-level development using systems languages such as C and Rust. I have experience with frontend web development using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS as well as backend web development using Python and Rust. I have dabbled in scripting languages like Lua for configuration and plugin development. I have some mildly succesful graphics experiments using OpenGL with C as well as software rendering using SDL.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			I daily-drive <a href="https://archlinux.org" target="_blank">Arch Linux</a> and have a good grasp of the command line. <a href="https://neovim.io" target="_blank">NeoVim</a> is the text editor I use with <a href="https://hypr.land" target="_blank">Hyprland</a> as my window manager. The colorscheme I use with just about everything, <a href="https://github.com/glitchcandy" target="_blank">glitchcandy</a>, is made completely custom by me; It's the colorscheme used on this site.
